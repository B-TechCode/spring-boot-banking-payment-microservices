# Spring Boot Banking & Payment Microservices

A production-style banking and bill payment platform built using Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Auth0, and Event-Driven Microservices Architecture.

## Architecture Overview

This project demonstrates how modern banks process customer onboarding, account management, transactions, bill payments, and settlement workflows using secure and scalable microservices.

### Microservices

- Customer Service
- AuthUser Service
- Account Service
- Payment Orchestrator Service
- Settlement Service
- Commons Security
- Commons DTO
- Commons Observability

---

## Key Features

### Customer Management
- Customer onboarding
- Customer profile management
- Customer validation

### Authentication & Authorization
- Auth0 integration
- OAuth2 Resource Server
- JWT validation
- Scope-based access control
- Token relay between microservices

### Account Management
- Create accounts
- Fetch account balances
- Account holds and releases
- Debit and credit operations
- Optimistic locking
- Idempotent requests

### Transactions
- Transaction ledger
- Debit transactions
- Credit transactions
- Server-side pagination
- Transaction history APIs

### Bill Payments
- Biller validation
- Fund reservation (Hold)
- Payment orchestration
- Kafka event publishing
- Batch settlement processing
- Retry and failure handling

---

## Event Driven Architecture

Kafka is used for asynchronous communication between services.

### Kafka Topics

```text
billpay.requested
billpay.enqueued
bill.batch.ready
bill.batch.submitted
billpay.status
